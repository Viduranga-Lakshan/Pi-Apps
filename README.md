Raspberry Pi App Store for Open Source Projects
Some of the best software available for the Pi plaform is the hardest to install.
Pi-Apps brings all this hard-to-install software to one place, and simplifies the installation process to two clicks with the mouse.

Basic usage
This is the main window:
main window
Use the main window to quickly browse the selection of apps and easily install them.
If you double-click an app, or select and app and click Details, you will see the Details window.
details
The updater window may pop up when you launch Pi-Apps, or when your Pi boots:
updates
Pi-Apps Settings can be configured by launching Menu -> Preferences -> Pi-Apps Settings.
settings
If you click New App in Settings, you can easily create your own Apps using the Create App Wizard. create app
It helps you select an icon, create & debug install/uninstall scripts, write a description, and more.
To-do
 Make app creation system. (completed with the createapp script)
 Add Pi-Apps to Twister OS. (completed on 11/2/2020 via the Twister 1.8.5 patch.)
 Make 32-bit and 64-bit install scripts.
 Allow multiple apps to be selected from the app list and be installed simultaneously.
 Add a search function to the app list. It's still experimental: to enable it, switch to xlunch in Pi-Apps Settings -> App List Style.
How it works
Each 'App' is simply a small install script, uninstall script, two icon sizes, and two text files containing the description and a website URL.
Each App is stored in its own separate directory. ~/pi-apps/apps/ holds all these app directories. The Zoom app, for example, would be located at ~/pi-apps/apps/Zoom/.
Because of the contained nature of each app folder, it's really easy to 'package' your own apps: just put the folder in a ZIP file and send it to friends. (or upload it as a new issue so your app can be added to Pi-Apps)
When you click Install, the selected App's install script is executed. (Or, in some cases, the install-32 or install-64 script is executed.)
When you click Uninstall, the selected App's uninstall script is executed.
Terminal usage
The manage script is similar to apt-get - it handles installing apps, uninstalling them, keeping them updated, and more. Manage does not include a GUI, though in some cases, a dialog may appear to ask you a question.
To install an app, run this: ~/pi-apps/manage install Zoom
To uninstall an app: ~/pi-apps/manage uninstall Zoom
To update a single app:
~/pi-apps/manage update Zoom Note that if an app is up-to-date, no files will be moved around.
To check all apps for updates:
~/pi-apps/manage check-all This command will return a list of updatable apps, separated by the | character.
To update all apps: ~/pi-apps/manage update-all Please note that this will not update the Pi-Apps main scripts! It only updates your apps and that's an important distinction.
To update everything: ~/pi-apps/updater
To list all apps: ls ~/pi-apps/apps Note that this will also list the template app, which is usually hidden.
App folder:
Each app folder contains some of these files:

credits Contains credits for the app. This file may mention who created the app originally, who compiled it, who submitted it to Pi-Apps, etc. Few apps use this file.
description This stores the app's description. If you hover your mouse over an app in the app list, it will display a tooltip derived from the first line of this file.
icon-24.png This is a 24x24 pixel icon that is displayed in the app list.
icon-64.png This is a 64x64 pixel icon that is displayed in the Details page.
install If the app installs correctly on both 32bit and 64bit, and it only needs one install script for either CPU type, one single install script is used.
install-32 This script installs an app on 32bit OS'es, and is 32bit-specific.
install-64 This script installs an app on 64bit OS'es, and is 64bit-specific. Sidenote: if an app only has an install-32 script, then Pi-Apps will assume it's for 32bit OS'es only and will hide that app on 64bit installations.
uninstall This script uninstalls the app. It must undo all changes made during install, but with one exception: It must not permanently delete any user-generated config! We don't want people's Minecraft worlds being deleted during an update.
Directory tree
~/pi-apps/ This is the main folder that holds everything. In all scripts, it is represented as the ${DIRECTORY} variable.
COPYING This file contains the GNU General Public License v3 for Pi-Apps.
createapp GUI script - this is run when you click "Create App" in Settings.
create app
gui The main GUI window. This script is responsible for displaying the App list and the Details page. main window
install This script is used to install Pi-Apps. Adds a couple menu launchers, and makes sure YAD is installed.
manage This script handles installing, uninstalling, and updating Apps. It does not check or update any files outside the apps/ directory.
pi-apps.desktop This file is a .desktop launcher, exactly the same as the main Pi-Apps launcher in Menu.
pkg-install If an App requires some apt packages in order to run, its install script will run pkg-install. Pkg-install records which app installed what (in the installed-packages folder BTW), so when you uninstall an App, those packages will be removed.
preload This script generates the app list for the gui script. If no files have been modified since last launch, preload won't regenerate the app list, but instead will return a previously saved version of the list. This approach reduces Pi-Apps's launch time by around 1 second.
purge-installed This does exactly the opposite of pkg-install This script is run when an App is being uninstalled. Purge-installed will uninstall all packages the app installed.

settings This GUI script is executed when you launch 'Pi-Apps Settings' from the Menu. settings
uninstall Uninstalls Pi-Apps and removes the menu launchers. Asks permission to uninstall YAD.
updater This GUI script is executed every time the gui script is launched. Updater first compares today's date against the last-update-check file. If it's time to check for updates, updater first checks for App updates, then checks for other files/folders that have been modified or created. If anything can be updated, a dialog will open and ask permission to update:
updates
data/ This folder holds all local data that should not be overwritten by updates.
settings/This stores the current settings saved by the 'Pi-Apps Settings' window. Each file contains one setting. For example, the file settings/Preferred text editor contains "geany" by default.
status/ This folder stores all installation information for all apps. If you install Zoom, then the status/Zoom file will be created, containing "installed". Installed apps will have this status icon in the app list: installed
If installation was unsuccessful, then the file will contain "corrupted". The corresponding icon looks like: corrupted
If the app has been uninstalled successfully, the icon is uninstalled
If the app has never been installed or uninstalled, then its status file will not exist. The icon for that is: none. Notice the slight amount of red in the center. That's how you can tell the difference.
update-status/ This folder keeps track of which apps can be updated. Each file's name is of an app, so update-status/Zoom stores the update status of the Zoom app. This folder is refreshed whenever ~/pi-apps/manage check-all is run. "latest" means that app is up to date. "new" means that app is new from the repository. (in other words, it does not exist locally) "local" means that app does not exist on the repository. "updatable" means the repository's version and the local version don't match.
preload/ This directory is used by the preload script to improve Pi-Apps' launch time.
timestamps This file stores timestamps for the most recently modified app, the most recently modified setting, and the most rencently modified status file. If any of these entries don't match when preload is called, then the app list will be regenerated.
LIST This file holds the app list. The entire file's contents is piped into the YAD dialog box.
installed-packages/ This keeps track of any/all APT packages each app installed. This folder is written to from the pkg-install script. For example, if Pi Power Tools installs xserver-xephyr and expect, then the installed-packages/Pi Power Tools file will contain "xserver-xephyr expect".
hidelist This file contains app names that should be hidden from the app list. template should always be there. If your Pi runs TwisterOS, then hidelist will contain several more app names, like balenaEtcher, for example.
last-update-check This contains a date in numeric form. (Jan. 1 would be 1, Dec. 31 would be 365.) The updater script uses this file to keep track of when updates were last checked.
etc/ This folder is basically an extension of the main pi-apps/ folder. Its contents don't need to clutter up the main directory, but they can't go in data/ because these files should be kept up-to-date.
setting-params/ This stores the GUI entries for the Settings window. For example, if I wanted to add a new setting called "Auto donate", with 'Yes' and 'No' parameters, with Yes being the default setting, I'd create a new file called setting-params/Auto donate and it would contain this:
#Donate automatically to Botspot every time Pi-Apps is launched
Yes
No
Now, the next time Settings is opened, you will see:
auto-donate With this file-based approach, adding new settings (and/or parameters) is much easier to do and in a standardized way. (As opposed to adding new settings by editing a bash script)
git_url This simple file stores this link: https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps If you fork this repository and make changes, you will want Pi-Apps checking for updates from your repository, not this main one. Simply change the URL in this file to switch to your repository.
icons/ This stores all the icons that are embedded into various dialogs.
screenshots/ Stores screenshots of various dialogs, mainly used as an image hosting service, though I suppose they could come in handy if an offline help dialog was made.
update/ This folder holds the latest version of the entire Pi-Apps repository. It's contents is re-downloaded every time the updater script checks for updates. It is used to compare file hashes, detect when an app or file can be updated, and is used to copy new file versions into the main pi-apps/ directory during an update.

Q&A with Botspot
Why did you develop Pi-Apps?
For a long time I have been saddened by how few people are aware of open-source RPi software projects. Many of these projects are extremely useful and beneficial, but there has never been a good way to distribute them.
The repositories don't host them, and they usually aren't advertised very well, so how will people find them?
Most people never find them.
One day I realized: Why not make my own app store that specializes in all the community RPi software projects out there? It will help more users find the software, and at the same time it would provide a super simple way to install them.
(Which would you rather do - click a shiny Install button, or copy-n-paste a bunch of commands from a sketchy blog tutorial?)

How long did it take to program this?
About two weeks of nearly non-stop coding to make Pi-Apps from the ground-up. And since then, I've regularly fixed bugs, solved problems, adding new features, and handled new app submissions.
